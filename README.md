### What I learned

The biggest obstacle was to center the two containers, that's what he used absolute centering. Then I designed the content of the QR code to be displayed on a minimum width of 375px.

-Absolute Centering in CSS

.min-display {
position: absolute;
left: 0;
right: 0;
top: 0;
bottom: 0;
margin: auto;
}
